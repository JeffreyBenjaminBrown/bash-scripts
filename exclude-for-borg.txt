# PITFALL: For infuriating reasons
#   with which I battled for maybe an hour and do not understand,
#   this file cannot have any empty lines,
#   and cannot end in a newline.
#
# PITFALL: Path separators are not treated differently
#   from other characters when matching against a single wildcard
#   (*) in the default match syntax, "Fnmatch".
#   For more fine-grained control,
#   I could use shell-selector syntax,
#   or something else.
